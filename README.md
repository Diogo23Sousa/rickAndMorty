Coding Challenge Instructions

Please develop a small webapp for searching Rick&Morty characters. There are two APIs - GraphQL (preferred) and REST - that you can use for that: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation.
The app should have a search bar with results shown below. When the user types something into the search bar he/she should be presented with suggested character names.
If the user presses enter, the character results for the entered search term should be shown. If the user clicks on one of the suggestions, the results for that suggestion should be shown.
Feel free to further design the user experience in a way you see fit.

But please try to not spend more than 3 hours on this exercise. Don't get lost in e.g. styling, error handling, or testing.
We don't want to see a perfectly programmed webapp, we rather want to see how you approach the problem.
